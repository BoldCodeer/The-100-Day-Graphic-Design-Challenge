The Core Rules:

Do Something Every Day: Even 30 minutes counts. Consistency is key.

Document Everything: Create a "Process Log" (a notebook or digital file) for each day.

Share Your Work: Post your daily creations on Instagram, Behance, or Dribbble. Accountability and feedback are crucial.

Focus on Progress, Not Perfection: The goal is to learn and improve, not to create a masterpiece every day.

Beginner's Mindset Tips:
Steal Like an Artist: In the beginning, it's okay to recreate work you admire to learn the how. Just don't claim it as your own.

Embrace the Ugly: Your first 30 days will be rough. That's normal and necessary.

Feedback is a Gift: Don't take it personally. Use it to see your work through someone else's eyes.

Done is Better Than Perfect. Ship your work, even if it has flaws.

This challenge is a marathon, not a sprint. Good luck, and enjoy the process of creating every single day
